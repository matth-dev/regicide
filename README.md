# Regicide - Regents and Robots

A Python implementation of the card game [Regicide](https://www.regicidegame.com) 

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is the implementation of an existing card game called Regicide in python.

The goal of this project is to sharpen my Python skills by adapting a card game into a Python script, my data pipelines skills by generating and using game data and my Machine Learning (and/or Deep-Learning) skills by training AI agents to play this game. (Most probably with help from the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html#) API).

## 🎮 Game Description

### Basic Rules
- **Players**: 2-4 players (Can be played as one player, but it's very hard since I decided to not implement the Jester mechanics for solo play)
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Objective**: Kill all Regents (Face Cards)
- **Gameplay**: There are a total of 12 face cards to defeat (4 Jacks, Queens and Kings), each with their own health and attack value. Each turn a player choose a combination of cards to attack the current regent (or skip his/her turn) and then discard cards to mitigate the current regent attack. The game is over when a player cannot discard enough card (loss) or when all regents are defeated (win).
